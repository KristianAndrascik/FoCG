## Goal:
The goal of this lab is to create a simple, interactive 3D application that incorporates both geometry and lighting. The focus is on the development of a graphics program and how to handle geometry, rotation, translation, user interaction, surface properties, and shading/illumination models. Most of the concepts are laid out in the book as well as discussed in class with example programs.
